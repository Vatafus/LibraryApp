# LibraryApp, using Spring, MySQL, JDBC, Mockito.
I implemented the back end system of an simple application used in a library.
For this app we implemented the following endpoints:
 - add a book â€“ allowsa user to add a new book, but if there is already a book with the same title, publisher and year of publication, we will receive a message.
 - get the list of all books - allows a user to get a list with all the books stored. The user can filter by the title of the book. The response will contain all the details of the books.
